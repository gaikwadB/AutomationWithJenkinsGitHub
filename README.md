# Automation With Jenkins, Git, GitHub and DevOps
This task is given by Vimal Daga Sir,in this project i implement the automation infrastructure integrating with Jenkins,Git and GitHub.

## Project Description:

  > 1.Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using dockerfile.
  
  > 2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.
  
  
  > 3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.
  
  
  >  4. Job1 : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
  
  
  >  5. Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image    container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).
  
  
  > 6. Job3 : Test your app if it is working or not. If app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages.
  
  
  > 7. Job4 : If container where app is running. fails due to any reson then this job should automatically start the container again.
  
  
  Before we implement this project we should have the following prerequisites.
  
 ## Prerequisites
 
 * OS: Base OS is Windows 10. Server OS is RedHat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL8) in Virtual Box.
 
 *  In RHEL8 some of the softwares needed are Docker (also need the php image downloaded in it), Jenkins (also github, build pipeline and email extension plugin should be installed in it).
 
* In Windows we need git bash software.

* At the starting stop the firewalld in RHEL8 and start the docker and jenkins services.

## Step By Step Procedure Of Creating This Project:

## 1. Creating Dockerfile and Building Personal Image using it :

   *Just see the below mentioned picture. Here I create one Dockerfile and run the build command. Remember one thing you have to run          this command particularly on that folder where you Dockerfile exits.
       
   * Here i have created image using following commands
         
         docker build -t myjen:v1 .
         
   * Here , i have define the code of Dockerfile:
      
          FROM centos:8

          RUN yum install wget -y
          RUN wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
          RUN rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
          RUN yum install java -y && yum install jenkins -y && yum install git -y && yum install sudo -y
          RUN echo -e "jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

          CMD java -jar /usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war

          EXPOSE 8080

## 2. Running the container and getting the files:
   
   In the below picture you can see that, docker image is creating with their required dependencies,packages etc.
      
   :![dataset](/Screenshots/building_image.png)
  
  
  After building the container, we can see in the below picture that we have created the one docker image file that name is myjetty:v1
  :[dataset](/Screenshots/image_done.png) 
  
  Once we creted a docker file you can run the container based on that myjeety:v1 image file.
  To run the container here is the command:
      
      docker run -it -P --previlleged -v /:/host --name myjen myjetty:v1
